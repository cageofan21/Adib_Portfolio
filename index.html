									<p>In this assignment, I used Excel to analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter Projects to uncover market tremds. <br>
									I used conditional formatting, created pivot tables, and a variety of charts to draw conclusions and understand limitations of the dataset.

									<p>I created a dashboard consisting of 7 pages in total to display Latitude Analysis using HTML and Bootstrap. These pages include:<br>
									1) Landing page of the dashboard <br>
									2) Four visualization pages - <br>

										<h2><a href="#">Python API Weather Data </h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PythonAPIS.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I created a Python Script to visualize the weather of 500 + cities across the world in terms of distance from the equator. Different libraries such as OpenWeatherMap, Citipy, Matplotlib, and Pandas helped to build scatterplots to show different relationships. A linear regression model helped to provide analysis between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. </p>

									<p>With the help of the JavaScript API call from the Mapbox website and the leaflet library of javascript, I was able to display a satellite map, basic street map, and a dark map of the earthquakes that took place from a 7 day period stretch. The earthquakes that had a higher magnitude were more darker in color, specifically orange to red. Upon clicking the circles, you will see a tooltip about a particular earthquake displayin information such as distance from a particular city, time of earthquake, and magnitude.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Tableau City Bike - JC Data</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Tableau.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Ten sheets, two stories, and two dashboards were created to convey the analysis uncovered from the Jersey City data. Number of bike trips (listed as numbers of records) was the main variable used throughout the analysis. Analysis was broken down between the starting stations and the ending stations. Two maps were created to display which starting and ending stations had the most number of bike trips. Turns out, Grove St. Path Station had the most amount of trips. In addition, several calculated fields were created such as classifying whether a station is busy or moderate and whether a biker enjoys riding based on a number of trips a biker takes. In dashboard 1, it was seen that there more bikers, riding from starting stations in totality, that enjoyed ridin than in comparison to the bikers reaching the ending stations. More stations were classified as busy in the starting stations than in the ending stations. In dashboard 2, we see the gender distribution across all stations (both starting and ending).In all, I concluded that most riders were males and very few were unknown.  </p>

										<h2><a href="#"> ETL Project </h2>
									</header>
									<a href="" class="image fit"><img src="images/CombinedETL.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Beautiful Soup library and basic Python to demonstrate the ETL process. Two sources of data were used. Beautiful Soup allowed the capability to scrape the World Series viewership statistics from the website https://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/wstv.shtml from 1973 onwards. I obtained another csv from Kaggle, where I downloaded it. The two Dataframes were then cleaned, joined by the team ID, merged, and loaded into Postgres database.

									<p> This project was geared to providing users with insight on the different recessions that occurred in the U.S. and to give a visual display on how certain stocks/industries were affected. I took responsiblity for shedding light on The Great Recession. In doing so, I used pandas Datareader (Yahoo Finance), HTML, and CSS to construct a webpage to inform others about The Great Recession.Furthermore, two charts were created showing a stock which did spectacular (the Dollar Tree Stock) and a stock which did poor (American Express Stock).  </p>

										<h2><a href=""> Machine Learning - Stock Price Trend </h2>
									</header>
									<a href="" class="image fit"><img src="images/RandomForest1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<a href="" class="image fit"><img src="images/RandomForest2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p> The stock I used was apple from January 1st, 2020 to May 1st, 2020. I used a Random Forest Classification Algorithm to determine whether the trend of the closing price would finish up or down from the day before. The model was then trained, tested, and produced an accuracy of about 95%. The accuracy just takes into account whether the closing price is up or down from the previous day,not taking into account by how much. A prediction column was created to label 0 for down day and 1 for an upday. The classification report metric was used to evaluate the model performance. The inbuilt 'feature_importance' tool was used to see the most important features driving the model. It turns out the column 'change_in_price' (closing price) was the most important feature driving this model.  </p>
